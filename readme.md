# OS Scheduling Visualizer

## About the Project
The OS Scheduling Visualizer is an interactive web application that demonstrates various CPU scheduling algorithms used in operating systems. It provides a visual representation of how different scheduling algorithms handle process execution, making it easier to understand their behavior and performance characteristics.

### Key Features
- Interactive 3D Gantt charts
- Support for multiple scheduling algorithms
- Real-time calculation of performance metrics
- Dynamic process input
- Comparative analysis of different algorithms
- Interactive visualization with rotation and zoom capabilities

## Tech Stack
1. **Frontend Technologies**
   - HTML5
   - JavaScript (ES6+)
   - Three.js for 3D visualization
   - Tailwind CSS for webpage designing

2. **Development Tools**
   - Visual Studio Code 
   - Git for version control
   - Node.js (for local development server)

## Data Structures and Algorithms

### Data Structures Used
1. **Arrays and Objects**
   - Process queue management
   - Timeline tracking
   - Result storage

2. **Priority Queues**
   - Implementation of SJF and SRTF algorithms
   - Process scheduling based on burst time

### Algorithms Implemented

1. **First Come First Serve (FCFS)**
   - Non-preemptive scheduling
   - Processes executed in arrival order
   - Time Complexity: O(n log n)

2. **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
   - Non-preemptive scheduling
   - Processes executed based on burst time
   - Time Complexity: O(n log n)

3. **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)**
   - Preemptive version of SJF
   - Continuous monitoring of remaining time
   - Time Complexity: O(n log n)

4. **Round Robin (RR)**
   - Time quantum based scheduling
   - Fair CPU distribution
   - Time Complexity: O(n * total_time/quantum)

## How to Run the Project

### Local Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vivekarya13/vivekarya12.github.io.git
   cd os-scheduling-visualizer
   ```

2. **Using Python's Built-in Server**
   ```bash
   # If you have Python 3 installed
   python -m http.server 8000

   # If you have Python 2 installed
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
   ```
   Then open http://localhost:8000 on your browser

3. **Using Node.js**
   ```bash
   # Install http-server globally
   npm install -g http-server

   # Run the server
   http-server
   ```
   Then open http://localhost:8080 in your browser

4. **Using VS Code**
   - Install "Live Server" extension
   - Right-click on index.html
   - Select "Open with Live Server"
   - Browser will open automatically

### Accessing the Deployed Version
1. Visit https://vivekarya13.github.io/vivekarya12.github.io
2. No installation required

Please note that we have hosted on github on a temporary basis for demonstration purposes only and may be removed later on. However, the github repository will still host the project (if the repository location is changed then the changes will be notified accordingly) so one can download the project and can host it either locally or on deployment sites like Heroku or Netlify.

### Usage Instructions
1. Select a scheduling algorithm from the dropdown
2. Enter the number of processes
3. Input arrival time and burst time for each process
4. For Round Robin, specify the time quantum
5. Click "Run Selected" to visualize one algorithm
6. Click "Run All" to compare all algorithms
7. Use mouse to rotate and zoom the Gantt charts
